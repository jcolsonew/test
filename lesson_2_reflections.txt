What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It created a .git directory.  Needed to create the repository so we can start to track
changes in git

How is staging different from working directory and repository?
Staging area is a temp area a file gets put in before it's placed in the repository.  Working directory
is just the folder you're working in.
