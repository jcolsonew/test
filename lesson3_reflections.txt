When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you want people to see/use your code.
If you don't have a good backup strategy in place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Chance of introducing bug, or overwriting what you've worked on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork allows me to copy a github repo to my github account
Clone allows copy either locally of a local repo or locally of a github repo
Branch allows me to take my repo and make changes without affecting the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Can easily do a diff against my local changes to see what's been done.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Perhaps use an intelligent file structure, but at the end of the day, anything one does would be 
manually or through workflow mimicking to a certain extent what git and github do.
