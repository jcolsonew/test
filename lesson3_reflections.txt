When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you want people to see/use your code.
If you don't have a good backup strategy in place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Chance of introducing bug, or overwriting what you've worked on.
